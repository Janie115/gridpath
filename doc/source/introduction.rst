Introduction
============

GridPath is a comprehensive grid analytics platform that integrates several
types of power system modeling approaches, including multi-stage
production-cost simulation, long-term capacity expansion, and
(eventually) price-based asset valuation. GridPath can simulate the operations
of the power system, capturing the capabilities of and constraints on
generation, storage, and transmission resources to understand grid integration
and flexibility needs. In capacity-expansion mode, GridPath can also identify
cost-effective deployment of conventional and renewable generation as well
as storage, transmission lines, and demand response.

GridPath has a flexible temporal and spatial resolution, and is designed for
easy application to different regions and systems. Each generation, storage,
and transmission resource can be modeled with a user-specified level of
detail. The platform can also optionally capture the effects on operations
and the optimal resource portfolio of forecast error, provision of ancillary
grid services, interconnection, reliability requirements such as a planning
reserve margin, and policies such as a renewables portfolio standard (RPS) or
a carbon cap.
